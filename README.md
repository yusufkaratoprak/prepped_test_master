### Tasks:
- Add a new backend api:
  - ```/download_external_logs``` makes a call to external service's api.
  - The external download API is dummy api, _you may leave it blank,_ however it requires $EXTERNAL_INTGERATION_KEY to authenticate
  - the external api has multiple enviroments so the integration key varies by enviroment
- Update the health check to fit the new archeticture
- Create helmchart for the stack
- Deployment via Ansible


#### Submission Guidelines:
